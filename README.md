# 📈 Evolution-of-Groundwater-Levels

💧These scripts will be very helpful when we have complex and large lists of time series in groundwater monitoring wells with the following
tasks:
✔️ Plots with normalized data on one graph, representing the data points by dots. Save the figure as pdf
✔️ Make plots with the normalized data for each groundwater body separately.
✔️ Plotting maps of difference between the average groundwater level and level in certain periods.
✔️ Spatial interpolation between oints (wells) to have fully covered maps.
✔️ Filtering data in time series of wells for certain periods.
