# Evolution-of-Groundwater-Levels

âœ…These scripts will be very helpful when we have complex and large lists of time series in groundwater monitoring wells with the following
tasks:
- Plots with normalized data on one graph, representing the data points by dots. Save the figure as pdf
- Make plots with the normalized data for each groundwater body separately.
- Plotting maps of difference between the average groundwater level and level in certain periods.
- Spatial interpolation between oints (wells) to have fully covered maps.
- Filtering data in time series of wells for certain periods.
